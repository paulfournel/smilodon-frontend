Strava Meets the Fediverse: How to Go Beyond Proof of Concepts?

I've noticed several enthusiasts dabbling with decentralized versions of Strava, sparking an idea to push these concepts further. I'm looking to ignite a conversation and connect with motivated individuals interested in launching an open-source project centered around a decentralized sports network. To kick things off, I've developed a proof of concept to showcase our potential starting point. If this piques your interest and you're eager to contribute your ideas, skills, or feedback, please drop a comment below. Let's connect and explore how we can turn this vision into reality together.

This project is using the activity pub protocol and therefore is compatible with Fediverse ecosystem.

The backend is available [here](https://github.com/paulfournel/smilodon-backend).

## Features

- Displays sport activity information retrieved from the backend
- Allows users to follow other users for any server
